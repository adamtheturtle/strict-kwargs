----

- ``strict-kwargs fix``: auto-rewrite surplus positional call arguments to
  keyword arguments (``--diff`` to preview). Conservative — only calls that
  resolve to a single known signature are rewritten (project code and the
  embedded typeshed builtins); overloaded callees, ``*args``/``**kwargs``
  unpacking, and ty-only resolutions are left untouched. The implicit
  receiver is skipped only for constructor/callable dunders and bound
  ``receiver.method(...)`` calls, so a standalone function whose first
  parameter is named ``self``/``cls`` is rewritten correctly.
- Ship a consumer-facing pre-commit hook (``id: strict-kwargs``) so projects
  can run strict-kwargs via `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_. A
  `strict-kwargs-pre-commit
  <https://github.com/adamtheturtle/strict-kwargs-pre-commit>`_ mirror
  installs the prebuilt PyPI wheel (no Rust toolchain required); the in-repo
  hook builds from source. See the README "pre-commit" section.
- Resolve calls into builtins, the standard library, and third-party
  packages: a pinned typeshed copy is vendored and embedded in the binary;
  third-party resolves from ``site-packages`` (PEP 561).
- Follow imports and re-exports (relative imports, ``from x import *``,
  package-root re-export chains, and module-level assignment aliases such as
  ``helper = _impl.real``); overload-safe (permissive) signature model.
- Optional ``ty`` type-inference fallback (drives a ``ty server`` over LSP):
  resolves inheritance/MRO, return-typed and annotation-typed receivers,
  locals bound from calls, and precise overloads. Fails closed; pipelined;
  robust to ty being absent/slow/changing.
- Cross-platform ``file://`` URI handling; CI runs the ty-backed suite on
  Linux and Windows.
- See ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` for the current state, capability matrix,
  parity status, and limitations.
